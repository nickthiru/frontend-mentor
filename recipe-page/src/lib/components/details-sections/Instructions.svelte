    <li><span class="inc-indent"><b>Beat the eggs</b>: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</span></li>
    <li><span class="inc-indent"><b>Heat the pan</b>: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</span></li>
    <li><span class="inc-indent"><b>Cook the omelette</b>: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</span></li>
    <li><span class="inc-indent"><b>Add fillings (optional)</b>: When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</span></li>
    <li><span class="inc-indent"><b>Fold and serve</b>: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</span></li>
    <li><span class="inc-indent"><b>Enjoy</b>: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</span></li>
